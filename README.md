## About

The purpose of the `lumino-tests` project is to provide tools which can act as complex automated tests and serve as complements to the RIF Lumino unit tests, for robustness purposes.

### How it works

## Getting started

Instructions are valid for Ubuntu.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker

To install Docker follow the official instructions at the [Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu) page. We recommend the _Install using the repository_ method.

**Make sure** to also follow the steps outlined in the first section of the [Post-installation steps for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) page, in order to manage Docker as a non-root user.
